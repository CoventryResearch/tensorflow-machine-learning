    "When training the model for 1M steps you can expect to get an accuracy of approximately of approximately 70% on the top-1 candidate. Note that this accuracy is sufficient to build the quickdraw game because of the game dynamics the user will be able to adjust their drawing until it is ready. Also, the game does not use the top-1 candidate only but accepts a drawing as correct if the target category shows up with a score better than a fixed threshold."
