    "## Introduction\n",
    "Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models ([Sutskever et al., 2014](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf), [Cho et al., 2014](http://emnlp2014.org/papers/pdf/EMNLP2014179.pdf)) have enjoyed great success in a variety of tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and text summarization. This tutorial gives readers a full understanding of seq2seq models and shows how to build a competitive seq2seq model from scratch. We focus on the task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) which was the very first testbed for seq2seq models with wild [success](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html). The included code is lightweight, high-quality, production-ready, and incorporated with the latest research ideas. We achieve this goal by:\n",

    "3. Providing tips and tricks for building the very best NMT models and replicating [Google’s NMT (GNMT) system](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45610.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "We first build up some basic knowledge about seq2seq models for NMT, explaining how to build and train a vanilla NMT model. The second part will go into details of building a competitive NMT model with attention mechanism. We then discuss tips and tricks to build the best possible NMT models (both in speed and translation quality) such as TensorFlow best practices (batching, bucketing), bidirectional RNNs, beam search, as well as scaling up to multiple GPUs using GNMT attention."

    "### Background on Neural Machine Translation\n",
    "Back in the old days, traditional phrase-based translation systems performed their task by breaking up source sentences into multiple chunks and then translated them phrase-by-phrase. This led to disfluency in the translation outputs and was not quite like how we, humans, translate. We read the entire source sentence, understand its meaning, and then produce a translation. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) mimics that!\n",
    "\n",
    "![encoder-decoder](encdec.jpg)Figure 1. **Encoder-decoder architecture** – example of a general approach for NMT. An encoder converts a source sentence into a \"meaning\" vector which is passed through a decoder to produce a translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, an NMT system first reads the source sentence using an encoder to build a [\"thought\" vector](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/21/google-a-step-closer-to-developing-machines-with-human-like-intelligence), a sequence of numbers that represents the sentence meaning; a decoder, then, processes the sentence vector to emit a translation, as illustrated in Figure 1. This is often referred to as the *encoder-decoder architecture*. In this manner, NMT addresses the local translation problem in the traditional phrase-based approach: it can capture *long-range dependencies* in languages, e.g., gender agreements; syntax structures; etc., and produce much more fluent translations as demonstrated by [Google Neural Machine Translation systems](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "NMT models vary in terms of their exact architectures. A natural choice for sequential data is the recurrent neural network (RNN), used by most NMT models. Usually an RNN is used for both the encoder and decoder. The RNN models, however, differ in terms of: (a) *directionality* – unidirectional or bidirectional; (b) *depth* – single- or multi-layer; and (c) *type* – often either a vanilla RNN, a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), or a gated recurrent unit (GRU). Interested readers can find more information about RNNs and LSTM on this [blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider as examples a *deep multi-layer RNN* which is unidirectional and uses LSTM as a recurrent unit. We show an example of such a model in Figure 2. In this example, we build a model to translate a source sentence \"I am a student\" into a target sentence \"Je suis étudiant\". At a high level, the NMT model consists of two recurrent neural networks: the *encoder* RNN simply consumes the input source words without making any prediction; the *decoder*, on the other hand, processes the target sentence while predicting the next words.\n",

    "For more information, we refer readers to [Luong (2016)](https://github.com/lmthang/thesis) which this tutorial is based on.\n",

There are many ways to perform decoding. Decoding methods include greedy, sampling, and beam-search decoding. Here, we will discuss the greedy decoding strategy.\n",

    "3. For each timestep on the decoder side, we treat the RNN's output as a set of logits. We choose the most likely word, the id associated with the maximum logit value, as the emitted word (this is the \"greedy\" behavior). For example in Figure 3, the word \"moi\" has the highest translation probability in the first decoding step. We then feed this word as input to the next timestep.\n",

    "Having gone through the most basic seq2seq model, let's get more advanced! To build state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems, we will need more \"secret sauce\": the *attention mechanism*, which was first introduced by [Bahdanau et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473), then later refined by [Luong et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025) and others. The key idea of the attention mechanism is to establish direct short-cut connections between the target and the source by paying \"attention\" to relevant source content as we translate. A nice byproduct of the attention mechanism is an easy-to-visualize alignment matrix between the source and target sentences (as shown in Figure 4).\n",

    "Remember that in the vanilla seq2seq model, we pass the last source state from the encoder to the decoder when starting the decoding process. This works well for short and medium-length sentences; however, for long sentences, the single fixed-size hidden state becomes an information bottleneck. Instead of discarding all of the hidden states computed in the source RNN, the attention mechanism provides an approach that allows the decoder to peek at them (treating them as a dynamic memory of the source information). By doing so, the attention mechanism improves the translation of longer sentences. Nowadays, attention mechanisms are the defacto standard and have been successfully applied to many other tasks (including image caption generation, speech recognition, and text summarization)."

    "# Background on the Attention Mechanism\n",
    "We now describe an instance of the attention mechanism proposed in (Luong et al., 2015), which has been used in several state-of-the-art systems including open-source toolkits such as [OpenNMT](http://opennmt.net/about/) and in the TF seq2seq API in this tutorial. We will also provide connections to other variants of the attention mechanism.\n",

We highlight in detail the first step of the attention computation. For clarity, we don't show the embedding and projection layers in Figure (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in Figure 5, the attention computation happens at every decoder time step. It consists of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current target hidden state is compared with all source states to derive *attention weights* (can be visualized as in Figure 4).\n",
    "2. Based on the attention weights we compute a *context vector* as the weighted average of the source states.\n",
    "3. Combine the context vector with the current target hidden state to yield the final *attention vector*.\n",
    "4. The attention vector is fed as an input to the next time step (*input feeding*). The first three steps can be summarized by the equations below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![attention-equation-0](attention_equation_0.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the function score is used to compared the target hidden state $h_t$ with each of the source hidden states $\\overline{h}_s$, and the result is normalized to produced attention weights (a distribution over source positions). There are various choices of the scoring function; popular scoring functions include the multiplicative and additive forms given in Eq. (4). Once computed, the attention vector $a_t$ is used to derive the softmax logit and loss. This is similar to the target hidden state at the top layer of a vanilla seq2seq model. The function f can also take other forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "![attention-equation-1](attention_equation_1.jpg)\n",

    "Various implementations of attention mechanisms can be found in [attention_wrapper.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_wrapper.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "***What matters in the attention mechanism?***\n",
    "\n",
    "As hinted in the above equations, there are many different attention variants. These variants depend on the form of the scoring function and the attention function, and on whether the previous state $h_{t-1}$ is used instead of $h_t$ in the scoring function as originally suggested in (Bahdanau et al., 2015). Empirically, we found that only certain choices matter. First, the basic form of attention, i.e., direct connections between target and source, needs to be present. Second, it's important to feed the attention vector to the next timestep to inform the network about past attention decisions as demonstrated in (Luong et al., 2015). Lastly, choices of the scoring function can often result in different performance. See more in the [benchmark results](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq#benchmarks) section."

    "# Attention Wrapper API\n",
    "In our implementation of the [AttentionWrapper](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_wrapper.py), we borrow some terminology from ([Weston et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916)) in their work on *memory networks*. Instead of having readable & writable memory, the attention mechanism presented in this tutorial is a *read-only* memory. Specifically, the set of source hidden states (or their transformed versions, e.g., $W\\overline{h}_s$ in Luong's scoring style or $W_2\\overline{h}_s$ in Bahdanau's scoring style) is referred to as the \"*memory*\". At each time step, we use the current target hidden state as a \"*query*\" to decide on which parts of the memory to read. Usually, the query needs to be compared with keys corresponding to individual memory slots. In the above presentation of the attention mechanism, we happen to use the set of source hidden states (or their transformed versions, e.g., $W_1h_t$ in Bahdanau's scoring style) as \"keys\". One can be inspired by this memory-network terminology to derive other forms of attention!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Building Training, Eval, and Inference Graphs\n",
    "When building a machine learning model in TensorFlow, it's often best to build three separate graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Training graph, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Batches, buckets, and possibly subsamples input data from a set of files/external inputs.\n",
    "* Includes the forward and backprop ops.\n",
    "* Constructs the optimizer, and adds the training op.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Eval graph, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Batches and buckets input data from a set of files/external inputs.\n",
    "* Includes the training forward ops, and additional evaluation ops that aren't used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Inference graph, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* May not batch input data.\n",
    "* Does not subsample or bucket input data.\n",
    "* Reads input data from placeholders (data can be fed directly to the graph via feed_dict or from a C++ TensorFlow serving binary).\n",
    "* Includes a subset of the model forward ops, and possibly additional special inputs/outputs for storing state between session.run calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building separate graphs has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The inference graph is usually very different from the other two, so it makes sense to build it separately.\n",
    "* The eval graph becomes simpler since it no longer has all the additional backprop ops.\n",
    "* Data feeding can be implemented separately for each graph.\n",
    "* Variable reuse is much simpler. For example, in the eval graph there's no need to reopen variable scopes with reuse=True just because the Training model created these variables already. So the same code can be reused without sprinkling reuse= arguments everywhere.\n",
    "* In distributed training, it is commonplace to have separate workers perform training, eval, and inference. These need to build their own graphs anyway. So building the system this way prepares you for distributed training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary source of complexity becomes how to share Variables across the three graphs in a single machine setting. This is solved by using a separate session for each graph. The training session periodically saves checkpoints, and the eval session and the infer session restore parameters from checkpoints. The example below shows the main differences between the two approaches.\n",
