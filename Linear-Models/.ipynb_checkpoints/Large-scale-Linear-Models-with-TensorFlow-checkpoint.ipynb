    "# What is a linear model?\n",
    "A linear model uses a single weighted sum of features to make a prediction. For example, if you have [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names) on age, years of education, and weekly hours of work for a population, you can learn weights for each of those numbers so that their weighted sum estimates a person's salary. You can also use linear models for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some linear models transform the weighted sum into a more convenient form. For example, logistic regression plugs the weighted sum into the logistic function to turn the output into a value between 0 and 1. But you still just have one weight for each input feature."

    "# How does tf.estimator help you build linear models?\n",
    "You can build a linear model from scratch in TensorFlow without the help of a special API. But tf.estimator provides some tools that make it easier to build effective large-scale linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature columns and transformations\n",
    "Much of the work of designing a linear model consists of transforming raw data into suitable input features. Tensorflow uses the FeatureColumn abstraction to enable these transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A FeatureColumn represents a single feature in your data. A FeatureColumn may represent a quantity like 'height', or it may represent a category like 'eye_color' where the value is drawn from a set of discrete possibilities like {'blue', 'brown', 'green'}.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of both continuous features like 'height' and categorical features like 'eye_color', a single value in the data might get transformed into a sequence of numbers before it is input into the model. The FeatureColumn abstraction lets you manipulate the feature as a single semantic unit in spite of this fact. You can specify transformations and select features to include without dealing with specific indices in the tensors you feed into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse columns\n",
    "Categorical features in linear models are typically translated into a sparse vector in which each possible value has a corresponding index or id. For example, if there are only three possible eye colors you can represent 'eye_color' as a length 3 vector: 'brown' would become [1, 0, 0], 'blue' would become [0, 1, 0] and 'green' would become [0, 0, 1]. These vectors are called \"sparse\" because they may be very long, with many zeros, when the set of possible values is very large (such as all English words).\n",
    "\n",
    "While you don't need to use categorical columns to use tf.estimator linear models, one of the strengths of linear models is their ability to deal with large sparse vectors. Sparse features are a primary use case for the tf.estimator linear model tools.\n",
