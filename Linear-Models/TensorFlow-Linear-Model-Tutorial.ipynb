In Logistic Regression, the probability of the label being positive ($Y=1$) given the features $\\mathbf{x}$ is given as:\n",

    "* Linear Model: First, we can see that $\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+b = b +\n",
    "    w_1x_1 + ... +w_dx_d$ is a linear model where the output is a linear function of the input features $\\mathbf{x}$. The bias $b$ is the prediction one would make without observing any features. The model weight $w_i$ reflects how the feature $x_i$ is correlated with the positive label. If $x_i$ is positively correlated with the positive label, the weight $w_i$ increases, and the probability $P(Y=1|\\mathbf{x})$ will be closer to 1. On the other hand, if $x_i$ is negatively correlated with the positive label, then the weight $w_i$ decreases and the probability $P(Y=1|\\mathbf{x})$ will be closer to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Function: Second, we can see that there's a logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) $S(t) = 1/(1+\\exp(-t))$ being applied to the linear model. The logistic function is used to convert the output of the linear model $\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}+b$ from any real number into the range of $[0, 1]$, which can be interpreted as a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model training is an optimization problem: The goal is to find a set of model weights (i.e. model parameters) to minimize a loss function defined over the training data, such as logistic loss for Logistic Regression models. The loss function measures the discrepancy between the ground-truth label and the model's prediction. If the prediction is very close to the ground-truth label, the loss value will be low; if the prediction is very far from the label, then the loss value would be high."
