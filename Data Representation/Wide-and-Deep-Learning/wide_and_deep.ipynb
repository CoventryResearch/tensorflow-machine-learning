    "# TensorFlow Wide & Deep Learning Tutorial\n",
    "In the previous [TensorFlow Linear Model Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide), we trained a logistic regression model to predict the probability that the individual has an annual income of over 50,000 dollars using the [Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). TensorFlow is great for training deep neural networks too, and you might be thinking which one you should choose—well, why not both? Would it be possible to combine the strengths of both in one model?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll introduce how to use the tf.estimator API to jointly train a wide linear model and a deep feed-forward neural network. This approach combines the strengths of memorization and generalization. It's useful for generic large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse input features (e.g., categorical features with a large number of possible feature values). If you're interested in learning more about how Wide & Deep Learning works, please check out our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792).\n",

    "The figure above shows a comparison of a wide model (logistic regression with sparse features and transformations), a deep model (feed-forward neural network with an embedding layer and several hidden layers), and a Wide & Deep model (joint training of both). At a high level, there are only 3 steps to configure a wide, deep, or Wide & Deep model using the tf.estimator API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select features for the wide part: Choose the sparse base columns and crossed columns you want to use.\n",
    "2. Select features for the deep part: Choose the continuous columns, the embedding dimension for each categorical column, and the hidden layer sizes.\n",
    "3. Put them all together in a Wide & Deep model (DNNLinearCombinedClassifier).\n",

    "Wide models with crossed feature columns can memorize sparse interactions between features effectively. That being said, one limitation of crossed feature columns is that they do not generalize to feature combinations that have not appeared in the training data. Let's add a deep model with embeddings to fix that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Deep Model: Neural Network with Embeddings\n",
    "The deep model is a feed-forward neural network, as shown in the previous figure. Each of the sparse, high-dimensional categorical features are first converted into a low-dimensional and dense real-valued vector, often referred to as an embedding vector. These low-dimensional dense embedding vectors are concatenated with the continuous features, and then fed into the hidden layers of a neural network in the forward pass. The embedding values are initialized randomly, and are trained along with all other model parameters to minimize the training loss. If you're interested in learning more about embeddings, check out the TensorFlow tutorial on [Vector Representations of Words](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec) or [Word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) on Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to represent categorical columns to feed into a neural network is via a one-hot or multi-hot representation. This is often appropriate for categorical columns with only a few possible values. As an example of a one-hot representation, for the relationship column, \"Husband\" can be represented as [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and \"Not-in-family\" as [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], etc. This is a fixed representation, whereas embeddings are more flexible and calculated at training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll configure the embeddings for the categorical columns using embedding_column, and concatenate them with the continuous columns. We also use indicator_column to create multi-hot representations of some categorical columns."

    "The higher the dimension of the embedding is, the more degrees of freedom the model will have to learn the representations of the features. For simplicity, we set the dimension to 8 for all feature columns here. Empirically, a more informed decision for the number of dimensions is to start with a value on the order of $\\log_2(n)$ or $k\\sqrt[4]n$, where $n$ is the number of unique features in a feature column and $k$ is a small constant (usually smaller than 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Through dense embeddings, deep models can generalize better and make predictions on feature pairs that were previously unseen in the training data. However, it is difficult to learn effective low-dimensional representations for feature columns when the underlying interaction matrix between two feature columns is sparse and high-rank. In such cases, the interaction between most feature pairs should be zero except a few, but dense embeddings will lead to nonzero predictions for all feature pairs, and thus can over-generalize. On the other hand, linear models with crossed features can memorize these “exception rules” effectively with fewer model parameters.\n",
