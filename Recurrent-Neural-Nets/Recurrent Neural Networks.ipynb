    "# Language Modeling\n",
    "In this tutorial we will show how to train a recurrent neural network on a challenging task of language modeling. The goal of the problem is to fit a probabilistic model which assigns probabilities to sentences. It does so by predicting next words in a text given a history of previous words. For this purpose we will use the [Penn Tree Bank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc99t42) (PTB) dataset, which is a popular benchmark for measuring the quality of these models, whilst being small and relatively fast to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is key to many interesting problems such as speech recognition, machine translation, or image captioning. It is also fun -- take a look [here](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we will reproduce the results from [Zaremba et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329), which achieves very good quality on the PTB dataset."

    "# The Model\n",
    "## LSTM\n",
    "The core of the model consists of an LSTM cell that processes one word at a time and computes probabilities of the possible values for the next word in the sentence. The memory state of the network is initialized with a vector of zeros and gets updated after reading each word. For computational reasons, we will process data in mini-batches of size batch_size. In this example, it is important to note that current_batch_of_words does not correspond to a \"sentence\" of words. Every word in a batch should correspond to a time t. TensorFlow will automatically sum the gradients of each batch for you.\n",

    "## Truncated Backpropagation\n",
    "By design, the output of a recurrent neural network (RNN) depends on arbitrarily distant inputs. Unfortunately, this makes backpropagation computation difficult. In order to make the learning process tractable, it is common practice to create an \"unrolled\" version of the network, which contains a fixed number (num_steps) of LSTM inputs and outputs. The model is then trained on this finite approximation of the RNN. This can be implemented by feeding inputs of length num_steps at a time and performing a backward pass after each such input block.\n",
