    "# Overview\n",
    "CIFAR-10 classification is a common benchmark problem in machine learning. The problem is to classify RGB 32x32 pixel images across 10 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details refer to the [CIFAR-10 page](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and a [Tech Report](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf) by Alex Krizhevsky.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to build a relatively small [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) for recognizing images. In the process, this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highlights a canonical organization for network architecture, training and evaluation.\n",
    "2. Provides a template for constructing larger and more sophisticated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason CIFAR-10 was selected was that it is complex enough to exercise much of TensorFlow's ability to scale to large models. At the same time, the model is small enough to train fast, which is ideal for trying out new ideas and experimenting with new techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlights of the Tutorial\n",
    "The CIFAR-10 tutorial demonstrates several important constructs for designing larger and more sophisticated models in TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Core mathematical components including convolution (wiki), rectified linear activations (wiki), max pooling (wiki) and local response normalization (Chapter 3.3 in AlexNet paper).\n",
    "* Visualization of network activities during training, including input images, losses and distributions of activations and gradients.\n",
    "* Routines for calculating the moving average of learned parameters and using these averages during evaluation to boost predictive performance.\n",
    "* Implementation of a learning rate schedule that systematically decrements over time.\n",
    "* Prefetching queues for input data to isolate the model from disk latency and expensive image pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide a multi-GPU version of the model which demonstrates:\n",
    "* Configuring a model to train across multiple GPU cards in parallel.\n",
    "* Sharing and updating variables among multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that this tutorial provides a launch point for building larger CNNs for vision tasks on TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "The model in this CIFAR-10 tutorial is a multi-layer architecture consisting of alternating convolutions and nonlinearities. These layers are followed by fully connected layers leading into a softmax classifier. The model follows the architecture described by [Alex Krizhevsky](https://code.google.com/archive/p/cuda-convnet/), with a few differences in the top few layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model achieves a peak performance of about 86% accuracy within a few hours of training time on a GPU. Please see below and the code for details. It consists of 1,068,298 learnable parameters and requires about 19.5M multiply-add operations to compute inference on a single image."

For regularization, we also apply the usual [weight decay](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/l2_loss) losses to all learned variables. The objective function for the model is the sum of the cross entropy loss and all these weight decay terms, as returned by the loss() function.\n",
