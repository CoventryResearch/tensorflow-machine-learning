    "## Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the-art model architecture for image classification tasks. CNNs apply a series of filters to the raw pixel data of an image to extract and learn higher-level features, which the model can then use for classification. CNNs contains three components:\n",
    "* Convolutional layers, which apply a specified number of convolution filters to the image. For each subregion, the layer performs a set of mathematical operations to produce a single value in the output feature map. Convolutional layers then typically apply a ReLU activation function to the output to introduce nonlinearities into the model.\n",
    "* Pooling layers, which downsample the image data extracted by the convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map in order to decrease processing time. A commonly used pooling algorithm is max pooling, which extracts subregions of the feature map (e.g., 2x2-pixel tiles), keeps their maximum value, and discards all other values.\n",
    "* Dense (fully connected) layers, which perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers and downsampled by the pooling layers. In a dense layer, every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a CNN is composed of a stack of convolutional modules that perform feature extraction. Each module consists of a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer. The last convolutional module is followed by one or more dense layers that perform classification. The final dense layer in a CNN contains a single node for each target class in the model (all the possible classes the model may predict), with a softmax activation function to generate a value between 0–1 for each node (the sum of all these softmax values is equal to 1). We can interpret the softmax values for a given image as relative measurements of how likely it is that the image falls into each target class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the CNN MNIST Classifier\n",
    "Let's build a model to classify the images in the MNIST dataset using the following CNN architecture:\n",
    "1. Convolutional Layer #1: Applies 32 5x5 filters (extracting 5x5-pixel subregions), with ReLU activation function\n",
    "2. Pooling Layer #1: Performs max pooling with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2 (which specifies that pooled regions do not overlap)\n",
    "3. Convolutional Layer #2: Applies 64 5x5 filters, with ReLU activation function\n",
    "4. Pooling Layer #2: Again, performs max pooling with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2\n",
    "5. Dense Layer #1: 1,024 neurons, with dropout regularization rate of 0.4 (probability of 0.4 that any given element will be dropped during training)\n",
    "6. Dense Layer #2 (Logits Layer): 10 neurons, one for each digit target class (0–9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf.layers module contains methods to create each of the three layer types above:\n",
    "* conv2d(). Constructs a two-dimensional convolutional layer. Takes number of filters, filter kernel size, padding, and activation function as arguments.\n",
